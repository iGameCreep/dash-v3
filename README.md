    <p>Discord BOT Dashboard - Updated by GameCreep35 ( iGameCreep )</p>
</h1>

# 📚 About
* This dashboard is an edited version of [Discord BOT Dashboard V2](https://github.com/LachlanDev/Discord-BOT-Dashboard-V2), the Dashboard is made to make **Discord BOT Development and use for users** easy, designed to use and create applications while using a user friendly Web-Dashboard and let users manage their servers easily !

# 🧰 What more than in the V2 ?
### 🧑 **User** :
* You now have the option to connect without being an admin and get an access to the User Dashboard, 
* The User Dashboard let users manage the bot on their servers.
### 📋 **Little changes** :
* If you don't have a profile picture for your account or your server, it will now put one of the basic one made by discord,
* A button on top of the "Logout" named "Administration Panel" only available for admins letting them use the Dashboard V2 to manage the bot ( all made by LachlanDev on the V2 ).
### 🔐 **Security** : 
* Unable for users to access the Administration Panel from the URL, auto redirect to the user dashboard. 
* Users can't access to the page of servers if they are not in, are not the owner and don't have MANAGE_GUILD or ADMINISTRATOR permissions. 

# ✏ Note
* This version of the dashboard isn't really made to include a bot, so the bot is not handling any commands as it was in the V2.


# 🚀 Installation / Setup
* Please refer to the README.md of <a href="https://github.com/LachlanDev/Discord-BOT-Dashboard-V2" target="_blank"> the original Dashboard </a> for the setup of the dashboard.
